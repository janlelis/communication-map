## Features

- Displays positions of other peers on a map
- Allows you to establish a chat connection to any peer in the network


## Details

- Unstructured overlay, no DHT or anything other fancy
- Other peers are used as "signaling channel" using data channels
- Uses the [palava.tv](https://palava.tv) server for bootstrapping, but this could also be
  done manually or with other servers
